        <h2>About me: </h2>
        <p>I am a full stack Java developer, with skills in frontend, backend, and database programming.
            My passion for solving problems and finding creative solutions to remedy those challenges has lead me to
            a career in software development. I have found that most things I enjoy can be found in 
            the creation of software which includes creative thinking, teamwork, problem solving, and 
            design.
