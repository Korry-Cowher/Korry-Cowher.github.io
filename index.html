            Hi I’m Korry, I am a current student at Tech Elevator’s Java bootcamp. I have a background in design
            research, CNC programming, precision machining, and technical leadership. I excel at critical thinking 
            individually and within a team environment. I have the ability to  evaluate problems and create solutions to remedy the issue, 
            which is my prime motivation throughout life. I’m inspired by facing complex problems, designing a plan, execution of goals, 
            and seeing the solution in action. Upon completion of Tech Elevator, I am pursuing a career where I am able to apply my skills 
            on a software  development team and to be challenged to continually grow.
